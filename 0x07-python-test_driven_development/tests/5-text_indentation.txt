This document uses doctest to test the function text_indentation

First, we import the function from the module

>>> text_indentation = __import__("5-text_indentation").text_indentation

try the function

>>> text_indentation("1.  Python is awsome. 2  : Is it better than C? I do not think so")
1
<BLANKLINE>
Python is awsome
<BLANKLINE>
2
<BLANKLINE>
Is it better than C
<BLANKLINE>
I do not think so

Now, we try a non-string

>>> text_indentation(-1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: text must be a string
